#+TITLE: Final Project - DD2412 Advanced Deep Learning

In this project, we are going to reproduce some part of the results from the paper [[Improved Autoregressive Modeling with Distribution Smoothing][https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15089]] by Meng et al., ICLR 2021.
Sampling functions generally taken from pixelcnn++ or original paper.
The report is available in report.pdf.
