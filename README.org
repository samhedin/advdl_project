#+TITLE: Final Project - DD2412 Advanced Deep Learning

In this project, we are going to reproduce some part of the results from the paper [[Improved Autoregressive Modeling with Distribution Smoothing][https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15089]] by Meng et al., ICLR 2021.

* TODO
- [ ] Use MNIST
- [ ] Make function to convolve an image from MNIST with gaussian noise
- [ ] Read about PixelCNN++. Can we use pre-trained weights?
- [ ] Can we try this type of convonlution instead? https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/scipy/auto_examples/solutions/plot_image_blur.html
