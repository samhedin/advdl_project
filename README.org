#+TITLE: Final Project - DD2412 Advanced Deep Learning

In this project, we are going to reproduce some part of the results from the paper [[Improved Autoregressive Modeling with Distribution Smoothing][https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15089]] by Meng et al., ICLR 2021.

* TODO
- [X] Use MNIST, ACTUALLY USE CIFAR10
- [X] Make function to convolve an image with gaussian noise
  - [X] Can we try this type of convonlution instead? https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/scipy/auto_examples/solutions/plot_image_blur.html

* Random thoughts
- [ ] Read about PixelCNN++. Can we use pre-trained weights?
- [ ] The amount of noise that the paper uses seems insanely high, as seen in =Autoregressive-Modeling-with-Distribution-Smoothing/configs/pixelcnnpp_conditioned_train_cifar10.yml=.
  - The images we generate with that amount of noise do not look like the presented images.

* How to SSH
Create =~/.ssh/config=
=conda activate adlenv=
