#+TITLE: Final Project - DD2412 Advanced Deep Learning

In this project, we are going to reproduce some part of the results from the paper [Improved Autoregressive Modeling with Distribution Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15089) by Meng et al., ICLR 2021.
 
* TODO
- [ ] Use MNIST
- [ ] Make function to convolve an image from MNIST with gaussian noise
- [ ] Read about PixelCNN++. Can we use pre-trained weights?
